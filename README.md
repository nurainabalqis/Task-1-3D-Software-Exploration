## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on exploring and comparing two 3D modelling software which is **Blender** and **Autodesk 3ds Max** by creating a simplified model of one of Malaysia’s most iconic landmarks, the **Sultan Abdul Samad Building**, located at **Merdeka Square, Kuala Lumpur**.

The objective is to understand how each software handles modelling tools, geometry editing, and object manipulation while applying techniques such as **extrusion**, **loop cuts**, and **inset faces**.

## 🧱 Modelling Process

### 🌀 Using Blender
- Added primitives: `Cube`, `Cylinder`, `Cone`, `Sphere`, `Plane`, and `Circle`
- Switched to **Edit Mode** and applied `Ctrl + R` for **loop cuts**
- Used **Extrude Along Normal** to form walls, windows, and door details
- Applied **Move (G)** and **Scale (S)** tools to adjust proportions
- Used **UV Sphere** for the dome at the top of the tower
- Added **basic materials and colors** for visualization

### 🧩 Using Autodesk 3ds Max
- Created primitives: `Box`, `Cylinder`, `Cone`, and `Hemisphere`
- Changed from **Default Shading** to **Edged Faces** view
- Converted objects to **Editable Poly** for polygon control
- Used **Inset** and **Extrude** for window and door divisions
- Adjusted proportions using **Move** and **Scale** tools
- Applied **material colors** (brown for walls, red for roofs) to resemble the real building

## 🏗️ Comparison Summary
| Feature | Blender | 3ds Max |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **Ease of Use** | Beginner-friendly, free, and simple interface | Professional tools with higher precision |
| **Extrusion Tools** | “Extrude Along Normal” for quick shaping | “Inset” + “Extrude” for detailed geometry |
| **Flexibility** | Great for experimentation | Best for architectural accuracy |
| **Performance** | Lightweight | Heavier but more robust |

## 🧠 Reflection
Through this task, I learned how both software approach 3D modelling differently.  
I became more confident using extrusion, scaling, and geometry editing tools.  
It also taught me patience and attention to detail while trying to make my model resemble the real **Sultan Abdul Samad Building**.

Overall, this task helped me grow in both **creativity** and **technical understanding** of 3D design.

## 🧰 Software Used
- **Blender 4.0**
- **Autodesk 3ds Max 2026**
